Drones + LSPIV: local flow-speed measurements 
==============================================

In this section we practice with High-Quality drone imagery and the RIVeR software (`RIVeR`_).

Based in `PIV-lab`_ .

By LSPIV processing of drone captured videos, river flow patterns can be detected and measured, like this recirculation as result of a expansion, 
and downstream a dyke.
