To understand how to transform a DSM from a Remote-Sensing device, as simple and affordable as a drone camera, in optical range (no LiDAR)
we describe the principles of the SMRF (Simple Morphological Filter): 



Training with affordable drones
-------------------------------

In this section we practice with High-Quality drone imagery and the Open-Drone-Map software (`ODM`_), to obtain DSMs and DTMs from simple flights to 
set the essential ground data for reliable simulations, at scales of a few hectares.
