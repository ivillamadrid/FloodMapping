Historical reviews
==================

As stated by Stoker, since 1957 it is clear and feasible to make predictions of floods in rivers knowing the state of the river at some initial instant,
and the observed-estimated or forecasted, flow into the river from its tributaries and the local run-off, through the basic differential equations we have roughly presented, and their associated numerical solutions solved by computers.


After more than 60 years of Stoker practices, the digital era with open access RS data and affordable computing processors, has popularized the Flood-Mapping science, a state of the art methodology can be found in "Flood Inundation Prediction" by Bates (2022), being the main challenges to face:
