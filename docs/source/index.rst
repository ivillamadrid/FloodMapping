Welcome to Flood-Mapping documentation
======================================

Flood mapping with the aid of computers and remote sensing imagery (satellites, airplanes and drones) requires cross-disciplinary but easy access information. The purpose of this online tutorial is to guide newcomers through the basic terminology with essential concepts and references, to support capacity building programmes.
